# Neuron Classifier CNN

Background-
    This is, as the title says, a convolutional neural network that attempts to classify
    different types of pyramidal neurons. I chose to create this because I am a neuroscience 
    and behavior major and I hope to use machine learning to aid neuroscience research in
    graduate school and beyond. A neural network such as this one (when fully optimized)
    could help distinguish types of neurons between different species.

Methods-
    The Neuron Classifier CNN follows an architecture similar to the kind used to evaluate
    the CIFAR-10 dataset available online. It can be broken down into
